# Basic-data-structure

Some data structures that were implemended and used for various uni assignments. They are abstract by using void pointers.
The destroy functions free the structure's nodes whereas the free methods free the corresponding values contained within the structure.

The Max heap is implemented as a dynamic tree and not a simple array (like ussually done) , this gives worse time complexity but doesn't need resizing.
